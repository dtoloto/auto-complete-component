# Auto-Complete Component

The Auto-Complete Component was built using pure ReactJS and Typescript, without any 3rd party libraries. 

It is a simple input component where users can search for USA Universities, but featuring an auto-complete functionality, suggesting some results based on what is being typed.

To list the USA Universities, this [API](http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?country=United%20States) was used.

[**DEMO**](https://auto-complete-component-six.vercel.app/)
***Obs: Demo link can present some issues because the Universities API is not using SSL connection, so the data can't be fetched***
